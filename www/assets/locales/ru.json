Choose the event which you believe the person or animal you are trying to locate would most likely be in. For example, if there was an event named Haiti Earthquake and the person you are seeking was last seen in Haiti, you would choose this event. You can select an event by tapping/clicking on the large green button under the image. This will take you directly to the search screen for this particular disaster event. A new search box will appear at the top after you have made your selection. Enter the name of the person you are attempting to locate in this search box and press Enter. The search results will update with the most relevant matches at the top. You may acquire more information about a result by tapping on the details link near the bottom of the record. This opens a detailed view in which you may view more detailed record information, add a comment of your own, or begin following a record to be notified about updates.",
