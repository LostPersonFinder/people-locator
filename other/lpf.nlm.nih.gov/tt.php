        These help you quickly gather incoming victim photos and identifying information at hospital triage, in support of your needs for 
        subsequent identification and family reunification. The software system, developed by NLM's Lost Person Finder Project, features 
        a central website, "TriageTrak", available for hosting at your hospital, and "TriagePic" apps that talk to it. In general, with both 
        TriageTrak and TriagePic, you may:

        Available through the Windows Store, this Modern UI app offers quick data entry and page navigation, by tablet touch, or by mouse and keyboard on 
        laptops or hybrid devices. On the New Report screen above, data entry is by checkbox tap, e.g., to indicate an adult or pediatric patient, or by 
        virtual or real keyboard, e.g, for optional names. Medical triage zones can be hospital-specific, e.g., "BH Green" is "Behavioral Health Green": 
        an arrival primarily needs a counselor. The 3 small colored squares (one of which brightens every few seconds) show Wi-Fi connectivity, so you 
        known whether "Send" will happen immediately or be queued.

        As simulated disaster victims arrive at a perimeter triage station, hospital personnel used TriagePic running on Windows 7 touch-screen tablets 
        to take photos and enter patient data (e.g., mass casualty IDs, initial treatment zones). This information is sent by hospital WiFi to TriageTrak, 
        where it could be accessed by hospital reunification counselors and emergency managers.
